# Bed Overhaul

![](https://github.com/Iru21/BedOverhaul/raw/master/src/main/resources/assets/bedoverhaul/icon.png)

Making this mod I wanted to address the issue where new players did not try to survive the first night my make a bed (or find it in a village) and just skip it!

When you install Bed Overhaul, you will first need to use a clock on a bed (just right click on it while holding!) to make it able to skip the night (or a thunderstorm). You will also need to use a compass on the bed if you want to set your spawn point. When breaking a bed the upgrades go away so you can't move your upgraded bed.

This will force players to actually try and survive the first night (or more) until they get the ability to skip it! It will hopefully also encourage players to have a main bed at their base and not carry one around (though having clocks in your ender chest isn't a big deal)
